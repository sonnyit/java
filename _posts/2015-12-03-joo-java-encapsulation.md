Encapsulation is one of four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Encapsulation is the ability to **package** *data* and *related behavior* in an **object bundle** and **control/restrict access** to them (both data and function) from other objects. It is all about **packaging related stuff together** and hide them from external elements.

We **should not misunderstood** that encapsulation is all about data hiding only. When we say encapsulation, emphasis should be on **grouping** or **packaging** or **bundling related data and behavior together**.

When we design a class in OOP, the first principle we should have in mind is encapsulation. Group the related data and its behavior in a bucket. **Primary benefit** of encapsulation is, **better maintainability**.
