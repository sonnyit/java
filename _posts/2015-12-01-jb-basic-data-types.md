### Tables

* [Primitive Data Types](#primitive-data-types-10548tables)
* [Reference Data Types](#reference-data-types-10548tables)
* [Java literals](#java-literals-10548tables)

There are two data types available in Java:

* Primitive Data Types: numeric types, boolean type, and returnAddress type.
* Reference/Object Data Types

## Primitive Data Types [&#10548;](#tables)
There are eight primitive data types supported by Java.

**Numeric Types**

* byte
  * 8 bit signed
  * minimum value is -128 (-2^7)
  * maximum value is 127 (2^7-1)
  * default value is 0
  * byte data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in place of integers, since a byte is four times smaller than an int.
* short
  * 16 bit signed
  * minimum value is -32768
  * maximum value is 32767
  * short data type can also be used to save memory as byte data type. A short is 2 times smaller than int.
  * default value is 0 
* int
  * 32 bit signed
  * minimum value is -2,147,483,648
  * maximum value is 2,147483,647
  * Int is generally used as the default data type for integer values unless there is a concern about memory.
  * The default value is 0
* long
  * 64 bit signed
  * minimum value is -2^63
  * maximum value is 2^63-1
  * this type is used when a wider range than int is needed
  * default value is 0L
* char
  * 16 bit unicode character
  * minimum value is ‘\u0000’ (or 0)
  * maximum value is ‘\uffff’ (or 65,535)
  * char data type is used to store any character

**Floating-point Primitives**

* float
  * 32 bit floating point
  * default value is 0.0f
* double
  * 64 bit floating point
  * default value is 0.0d

**Boolean type Primitive**

* boolean
  * one bit
  * there are only two possible values: true and false.
  * default value is false 

## Reference Data Types [&#10548;](#tables)

* Reference variables are created using defined constructors of the classes. They are used to access objects. These variables are declared to be of a specific type that cannot be changed.
* Class objects, and various type of array variables come under reference data type.
* Default value of any reference variable is null.
* A reference variable can be used to refer to any object of the declared type or any compatible type.
* Example: Animal animal = new Animal("giraffe");

## Java literals [&#10548;](#tables)
A literal is a source code representation of a fixed value. They are represented directly in the code without any computation.
